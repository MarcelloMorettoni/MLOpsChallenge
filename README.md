# MLOpsChallenge
This is a MLOPS example for robotics which I made in two days due to my interests in it.

# Objective
Develop an AI model that detects blue cubes and ignores other colors.
Implement an MLOps workflow to manage the model's lifecycle.
Integrate DevOps practices to align with the job requirements.

# Project Overview
Hardware: Robotic arm controlled via serial communication.
Middleware: Node-RED acting as the API layer to send commands to the robotic arm.
Model: A computer vision model that detects blue cubes in real-time.
MLOps Workflow: Automate model training, versioning, deployment, and monitoring.
