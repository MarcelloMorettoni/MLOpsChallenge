# MLOpsChallenge
This is a MLOPS example for robotics which I made in two days due to my interests in it.

# Objective
To train a model that detects cubes.
Implement an MLOps workflow to manage the model's lifecycle.
Integrate DevOps practices to align with standard best practices.

# Project Overview
Hardware: Robotic arm controlled via serial communication.

Middleware: Node-RED acting as the API layer to send commands to the robotic arm.

Model: A computer vision model that detects blue cubes in real-time.

MLOps Workflow: Automate model training, versioning, deployment, and monitoring.

Bonus: Chatbot to upload images and test the models 

# Dataset:
I used a dataset from Kaggle, since I had only two days:

# Hardware:
The robotic arm used is the Adeept 5-DOF:
