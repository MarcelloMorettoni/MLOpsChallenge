# Project Overview

# Day 1 Plan
Morning: Model Development
Set Up Development Environment

Install Necessary Libraries:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
MLflow for MLOps tracking
Create a Virtual Environment:
Use venv or conda to manage dependencies.
Develop the Model

Option 1: Classical Computer Vision (Recommended for Time Constraints)

Color Detection with OpenCV:

Use HSV color space to detect blue color.
Apply color thresholds to create a mask for blue objects.
Use contour detection to find the blue cube's position.
Implementation Steps:

Capture video stream from the camera.
Convert each frame to HSV color space.
Define HSV ranges for blue color.
Create a mask and find contours.
Determine the cube's coordinates.
Option 2: Simple Machine Learning Model

Data Collection:
Capture images of blue cubes and other colored cubes.
Model Training:
Use a simple CNN with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Due to time constraints, this may be too ambitious.
Test the Model

Ensure the model accurately detects blue cubes.
Tweak HSV ranges or model parameters as needed.
Afternoon: Integrate with Robotic Arm
Connect Model Output to Node-RED

Create an API Endpoint:
Use Node-RED to expose an endpoint that triggers the robotic arm.
Send Commands to Node-RED:
From your Python script, send an HTTP request to Node-RED when a blue cube is detected.
Control the Robotic Arm

Node-RED Flow:
Receive the API call.
Send serial commands to the robotic arm to pick up the cube.
Test the Integration:
Place a blue cube and verify the arm picks it up.
Place other colored cubes and ensure the arm does not react.
Evening: Containerization and Version Control
Containerize the Application

Create a Dockerfile:

Base image: python:3.9-slim
Install dependencies.
Copy your application code.
Set the entry point.
Build and Test Docker Image:

Build the image locally.
Run the container and ensure everything works.
Version Control

Initialize Git Repository:
Commit your code and Dockerfile.
Write a clear README.md explaining how to run the application.

# Day 2 Plan

Morning: MLOps Workflow Setup
Implement MLflow for Model Tracking

Set Up MLflow Tracking Server:
You can run it locally or use a remote server.
Integrate MLflow with Your Model Script:
Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
Version your model each time it's trained.
Automate Model Training and Deployment

Create a CI/CD Pipeline:

Use GitHub Actions for quick setup.
Define workflows to:
Trigger on code push or pull request.
Build the Docker image.
Run any tests (if time permits).
Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
Deployment Automation:

Use Ansible to automate deployment to your environment.
Infrastructure as Code

Terraform Scripts:
If deploying to a cloud service, write Terraform scripts to provision resources.
Given the time constraint, you can simulate this step or prepare the scripts without actual deployment.
Afternoon: Deployment and Monitoring
Deploy to Kubernetes

Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster:
Use Minikube for local deployment or Kind.
Create Kubernetes Manifests:
Deployment and Service YAML files.
Use Helm to package your application for deployment.
Deploy the Application:
Apply the manifests or install the Helm chart.
Ensure the application is running smoothly.
Implement Monitoring

Set Up Prometheus and Grafana:

Deploy using Helm charts for quick setup.
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application.
Create Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics.
Application Metrics:

Instrument your application to expose metrics, such as:
Number of detections.
Processing time per frame.
System resource usage.
Logging

Set Up Logging Solution:
Use Kubernetes logging to capture stdout and stderr.
For advanced logging, deploy the EFK Stack.
Given time constraints, focus on ensuring logs are accessible.
Evening: Security and Documentation
Implement Basic Security Measures

Secure Kubernetes Cluster:

Use Kubernetes RBAC to control access.
Configure Network Policies to restrict traffic.
Secure Application:

Handle secrets securely using Kubernetes Secrets.
Ensure APIs are not exposed unnecessarily.
Finalize Documentation

Update README:

Include instructions for setting up the environment.
Explain how to run and test the application.
Architecture Diagram:

Create a simple diagram showing how components interact.
Tools: draw.io or Lucidchart.
Deployment Guide:

Document steps for deployment using CI/CD pipeline.
Explain how the MLOps workflow is implemented.
